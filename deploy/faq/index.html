around the world, candidates are strongly encouraged to use
English during the event, but should feel free to use Hebrew
as well.</p></div></section><section id="what-happens" class="question"><p><strong>What happens at 3DS?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>You and ~40 other Technion students and Haifa entrepreneurs
will start a technology company over the course of three
days. We</p><ul><li>Reserve round-the-clock work space for an entire three day event;</li><li>Invite 40 star students with a wide range of backgrounds;</li><li>Cater food, drinks, snacks, and tea / coffee;</li><li>Pick a few of the best ideas for a tech startup (often net-, web-,
or software-focused, due to intense time pressure) during the
Wednesday brainstorming session;</li><li>Release a minimal prototype by Thursday night;</li><li>Make a final business pitch and technology demo on Friday afternoon.</li></ul><p>The goal is to build enough momentum among a network of motivated
people to sustain the company beyond the event.</p></div></section><section id="what-do-i-get" class="question"><p><strong>If I participate, what do I get out of the event?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>The worst case scenario is that you will work with brilliant people
from numerous disciplines toward the common goal of building real
companies and products. Great connections happen at 3-Day Startup:
cofounders meet, complimentary skill sets collide, and friends are
made.</p><p>The best case scenario is that you will be a cofounder of a wildly
successful new tech startup.</p></div></section><section id="discipline-distribution" class="question"><p><strong>How many people do you invite into the event? Which disciplines do
they typically come from?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>We typically interview a few hundred applicants, and then choose the
40 (+/-5) participants from that group. The participants have
backgrounds in a range of fields: technical, managerial / business,
creative, and others (historically, in decreasing percentage of
representation, due to practical needs of the event).</p></div></section><section id="major" class="question"><p><strong>I&#8217;m a student majoring in X. Should I even consider applying?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>The short answer is: yes.</p><p>Our past participants have spanned everything from a first-year
undergraduate in psychology to a freshly minted PhD in Neuroscience.
If you&#8217;re at all passionate about startups and technology, it is
likely that you will be a valuable participant.</p></div><section id="team-application" class="question"></section><p><strong>We are a number of students who are a team. Can we apply as one?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>The short answer is: no.</p><p>3DS is best suited for individuals who come to form a team.
If you already have a team and an idea a more suitable framework is<a href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html" target="_blank"> BizTEC.</a> Technion3DS takes in individuals and creates teams and it is best to
come with an open attitude to make the most of the platform and to allow
other to make the most of it.</p></div></section><section id="non-technion" class="question"><p><strong>Can non Technion students apply?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>The short answer is: yes.</p><p>While this event is by the Technion Bronica Entrepreneurship Center
and is addressed at Technion students, we acknowledge that diverse
backgrounds and disciplines enrich the creative environment.</p></div></section><section id="schedule" class="question"><p><strong>What does the event schedule look like?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>A typical event might look like this:</p><p>Wednesday</p><ul><li>Morning: meet and pitch ideas</li><li>Noon: announce ideas and split to groups</li><li>Start work!</li></ul><p>Thursday</p><ul><li>Customer interaction, coding, market validation, business plans, logos, etc.</li></ul><p>Friday</p><ul><li>8am: breakfast &amp; continue work</li><li>12pm: pitch startup(s) to panel</li></ul></div></section><section id="accomplishment" class="question"><p><strong>How much can you really accomplish in 3 days?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>A whole lot. The finished product of the event isn&#8217;t a
full-fledged revenue-generating company &#8211; it&#8217;s a team with an idea
and a functional prototype of a product or service, with enough
momentum to become a real company.</p></div></section><section id="food-and-sleep" class="question"><p><strong>What about food? Sleep?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>Technion 3DS caters all meals, drinks, and in-between snacks
(pending successful sponsorship drive). Sleep is
optional. Participants can bring a sleeping bag, or they can
go home to rest.</p></div></section><section id="endpoint" class="question"><p><strong>What happens at the end of the three-day event?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>At the conclusion of our event, participants pitch their startups to a panel
of local venture capitalists, angel investors, tech entrepreneurs,
professors, and the press. After that, they start making plans about
how to take their companies forward.</p></div></section><section id="how-to-get-ideas" class="question"><p><strong>How do you get good ideas for startups?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>We can point you toward a few resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AjymQZQd9doudG92SG9yRDRQb2ViNzJodXVnWWtGUVE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CISu95AF" target="_blank">Spreadsheet with hundreds of startup ideas by many different folks</a></li><li><a href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html" target="_blank">Y Combinator&#8217;s list of ideas they&#8217;d like to fund</a></li><li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham&#8217;s article on startup ideas</a></li><li><a href="http://www.sixmonthmba.com/2009/02/999ideas.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin&#8217;s Six Month MBA class 999 ideas</a></li></ul></div></section><section id="selecting-idea" class="question"><p><strong>Any pointers on selecting a startup idea?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>That&#8217;s a tough question with a long answer. Even some of the best
venture capitalists in the business have trouble answering that
question. Just check out<a href="http://www.bvp.com/portfolio/antiportfolio" target="_blank">Bessemer Venture Partners&#8217; anti-portfolio</a>. Probably the best advice we can give you is to check out what some
of the smartest people in the business have written. Two of the
first people you might check out are<a href="http://steveblank.com/about/" target="_blank">Steve Blank</a>and<a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/about/" target="_blank">Ash Maurya</a>. Both of those guys also have books. One of the biggest takeaways
is just to talk to customers. We can also try to give some very brief
pointers on startup ideas:</p><p>Good ideas do not need to be:</p><ul><li>Unique</li><li>Complex</li><li>Clever</li><li>First to market</li><li>High-technology</li><li>Free of competitors</li><li>Based on a patent</li><li>Something you thought of yourself</li></ul><p>Good ideas probably should:</p><ul><li>Address a real, observable market pain</li><li>Be something that you are knowledgeable about</li><li>Have a large, potential or existing market</li><li>Have possible revenue streams</li><li>Evoke enormous passion in you and your team!</li></ul></div></section><section id="stolen" class="question"><p><strong>I have a great idea or invention. I&#8217;m worried about it being stolen.</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>This is a common, and reasonable, concern for 3DS participants. Our
past experience has shown this not to be an issue, at all.</p><p>We believe firmly that ideas are cheap and execution is everything,
which is why we focus most of our attention on action. But don&#8217;t
just take it from us: there is broad consensus on that topic in the
startup community. See<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/05/the-value-of-ideas/" target="_blank">here</a>,<a href="http://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-crucial-to-the-success-of-a-startup-the-idea-or-the-execution" target="_blank">here</a>,<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and<a href="http://sivers.org/multiply" target="_blank">here</a>for just a few examples. In short, your teammates, and the panelists
involved with 3DS, are in the business of making ideas happen, not
stealing them. It&#8217;s far more lucrative that way!</p></div></section><section id="ideas-allowed" class="question"><p><strong>What kind of ideas are allowed?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>Ideas with scalable business models are strongly preferred. We also
optimize the event for ideas that will require a strong software
base.</p><p>Our selection criteria for ideas are (1) your amount of passion and
(2) the amount of research on your own idea that you perform before
your interview.</p></div></section><section id="picking-idea" class="question"><p><strong>How are ideas picked?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>Ideas will go though two stages of selection. The first selection is
the interview that all participants go through to get accepted into
a 3-Day Startup event. During the interview, we are looking for a
combination of skills in your area, passion, and a well-researched
startup idea.</p><p>The final idea selection is during the event. It begins with the ~40
people forming ~8 groups of ~5 people each. The small groups
brainstorm and pick their favorite ideas. Then each group pitches
their top idea to the other groups. At the end, all participants
vote on the top few ideas.</p></div></section><section id="who" class="question"><p><strong>Who is this non-profit, anyway?</strong></p><div class="answer"><p>Technion 3DS is organized by<a href="/about/#students">student volunteers</a> from the Technion, and overseen by a<a href="/about/#faculty-adviser">faculty adviser</a> and<a href="/about/#steering-committee">steering committee</a>. Globally, our &#8220;parent&#8221; organization is<a href="http://3daystartup.org/" target="_blank">3 Day Startup, Inc.</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation in the United States.</p><p>3 Day Startup, Inc. has no shareholders, only<a href="http://3daystartup.org/our-team/" target="_blank">a board of directors</a>mainly composed of current and former University of Texas students.
These are the people who created the original 3-Day Startup event in
Spring of 2008. 3 Day Startup, Inc., is organized for the express
purpose of promoting entrepreneurship on college campuses.</p></div></section></div><div class="aside span3"><!----><!-- TODO: add social media networks--><!----><div id="social" class="well"><p style="text-align:center">Follow us on<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Technion3DS" target="_blank"><i class="just-vector">F</i> Facebook</a> &amp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Technion3DS" target="_blank"><i class="just-vector">t</i> Twitter</a>!</p></div><div id="event-details" class="well"><h3><a href="/info/" style="color:inherit;font-size:22px">Event Details</a></h3><table style="margin-bottom:10px" class="table table-condensed"><tbody><tr><th>Time</th><td>January 2 &ndash; 5, 2019<br>(runs sixty hours from Tue eve, Wed noon to Fri afternoon)</td></tr><tr><th>Venue</th><td>TBD<br>Technion, Haifa</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="margin-bottom:0"><b>Key outcomes</b></p><ul style="margin-bottom:20px"><li>Meet smart people</li><li>Enjoy free food and good friends</li><li>Learn about entrepreneurship</li><li>Push your abilities &amp; limits</li><li>Start real high-tech company</li><li>Make real product / service</li><li>Get funding (if good enough!)</li></ul><p style="margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center" class="apply"><a href="/apply/" class="btn btn-primary">Apply Now</a></p><p><a href="/about/#students">Recruiting</a>:<a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#058;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#114;&amp;#117;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#103;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#051;&amp;#100;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a><br><a href="/about/#students">Sponsorship</a>: Shai Haim<a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#058;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#105;&amp;#112;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#051;&amp;#100;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a><br><a href="/about/#students">Chairman</a>: Shai Haim<a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#058;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#114;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#051;&amp;#100;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a><br><a href="/about/#faculty-adviser">Faculty Adviser</a>:<a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#058;&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#118;&amp;#105;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#104;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#051;&amp;#100;&amp;#115;&amp;#046;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;"><i class="icon-envelope"></i></a></p></div><p style="text-align:center;color:#aaa;text-shadow:0 1px #fff">First in Student Startups</p><p style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:0"><img src="/images/logo-32-grey.png" class="aside-logo"></p></div></div></div><div class="thru-container footer-container"><div class="container"><div class="footer"><p>&copy; 2018, Technion 3DS | 3-Day Startup - Learning by Doing</p><p><a href="http://3daystartup.org/" target="_blank">Global 3DS Website</a></p></div></div></div><script src="/scripts/jquery-1.12.3.min.js"></script><script src="/scripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/scripts/html5shiv.js"></script><script>var _gaq = _gaq || [];
